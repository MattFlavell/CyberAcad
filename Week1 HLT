FavouriteMain = input("What is your favourite main? ")
FavouriteDessert = input("What is your favourite dessert? ")

#Second Task- Motorbike depreciation

#It does the maths correctly but the while loop is ineffective, not sure how to link the iteration function and the loop together

#Variables
BikeCost = int(2000)
Depreciation = float(0.9)
Year1 = (BikeCost*Depreciation)
Year2 = (Year1*Depreciation)
Year3 = (Year2*Depreciation)
Year4 = (Year3*Depreciation)
Year5 = (Year4*Depreciation)
Year6 = (Year5*Depreciation)
Year7 = (Year6*Depreciation)
Years = (Year1, Year2, Year3, Year4, Year5, Year6, Year7)
Iteration = iter(Years)
#Syntax
while BikeCost >= 2500:
  print(next(Iteration))
else:
    print("The bike is now worth less than Â£1000")
